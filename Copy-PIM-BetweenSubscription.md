This PowerShell script is designed to copy role eligibility and their management policies (Role settings) from a source subscription to a destination subscription in Azure.

Here's a breakdown of the key actions performed by the script:

1. Import the Az.Resources module, which provides access to Azure Resource Manager cmdlets that allow you to manage Azure resources.
2. Prompt the user to authenticate to Azure and select both the source and destination subscriptions.
3. Fetch the list of role management policy assignments from both the source and destination subscriptions.
4. Retrieve a list of role eligibility schedules from the source subscription.
5. Iterate over each unique role definition ID in the list of role eligibility schedules from the source subscription.
6. For each role definition ID, retrieve the corresponding role management policy assignment from both the source and destination subscriptions.
7. Retrieve the policy details for the source role management policy assignment and update the policy for the destination role management policy assignment with the same details.
8. Iterate over each role eligibility schedule in the source subscription and recreate it in the destination subscription.

Overall, this script is useful for copying role eligibility and their management policies (settings) from one Azure subscription to another, which can be helpful when setting up new environments or migrating resources between subscriptions.
